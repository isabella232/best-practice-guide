In this deployment scenario, there is a single Rancher control plane managing Kubernetes clusters  across the globe. The control plane would be run in an HA configuration, and there would be impact due to latencies.

### Pros:

* Environments could have nodes and network connectivity across regions.
* Single control plane interface to view/see all regions and environments.
* Kubernetes does not require Rancher to operate and can tolerate loosing connectivity to the Rancher control plane. 

### Cons:

* Subject to network latencies
* If control plane goes out global provisioning of new services is unavailable until restored. However each Kubernetes cluster can continue to be managed indvidually.
